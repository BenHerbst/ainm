## Everything is a file 💾
With this project managment tool, everything is a file. Your todolists are .todo files and your kanbans .knbn ...
You can store everything local on you computer and directly in your project. For example: figures/player/player.todo, if you are a Game-Developer and you want to manage planning of the player.
